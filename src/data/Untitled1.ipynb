    "### Same Size Clustering ###\n",
    "###\n",
    "### This is a variation of the k-means clustering that produces equally sized clusters.\n",
    "### The algorithm consists of two phases:\n",
    "### 1. Initialization:\n",
    "###     Compute the desired cluster size: n/k\n",
    "###     Initialize means with k-means\n",
    "###     Order points by the biggest benefit (delta distance) of best over worst assignment\n",
    "###     Assign points to their prefered cluster until the cluster is full, then resort remaining\n",
    "###     objects by excluding the clusters that are full.\n",
    "### 2. Refinement of clustering:\n",
    "###     This is done in an iterative fashion, until there is no change in clustering or the max\n",
    "###     number of iterations have been reached.\n",
    "###     Interation:\n",
    "###         Compute current cluster means.\n",
    "###         For each object, compute the distance to the cluster means.\n",
    "###         Sort elements based on the delta of the current assignment and the alternative best \n",
    "###         possible assignment, sort in descending order.\n",
    "###         For each element by priority:\n",
    "###             For each cluster to whom it doesn't belong, by element gain:\n",
    "###                 if there is an element on the transfer list of the cluster, and swapping the \n",
    "###                 two element yields improvement, swap the two elements;\n",
